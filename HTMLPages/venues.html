                    <p class="mb-0">
                        Madison Square Garden is known for being busy and high-energy, especially on nights with major
                        artists. Fans often mention that security and ticket scanning lines can be long, so arriving
                        early is helpful. Inside, the sound is usually strong and clear, with most seats having at least
                        a decent view of the stage or large screens. It’s a good choice for people comfortable with big
                        crowds and a lot of movement in the halls before and after the show.

                    <p class="mb-1"><strong>Capacity:</strong> Very large, used for tours and festivals</p>
                    <p class="mb-0">
                        MetLife Stadium hosts some of the biggest tours, which means large crowds, heavy traffic, and
                        a lot of walking between parking, gates, and seats. Fans often mention that weather can have a
                        big impact on comfort since the stadium is open-air. The energy level is usually high, and the
                        experience feels huge, but first-time visitors should plan ahead for transportation, layers for
                        changing temperatures, and extra time to get in and out of the venue.

                    <p class="mb-1"><strong>Capacity:</strong> Very large, designed for big production shows</p>
                    <p class="mb-0">
                        SoFi Stadium is newer and built with big productions in mind, so shows often include large
                        screens, detailed lighting, and strong sound systems. Fans describe the inside as clean and
                        organized, but the area around the stadium can still feel crowded on event days. Lines for
                        food, merch, and restrooms can get long during breaks. This venue fits people who want a very
                        modern, high-production concert experience and don’t mind navigating a large, busy space.
