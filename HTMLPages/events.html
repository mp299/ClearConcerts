            review, with details about timing, atmosphere, and what the night was actually like.

                    <p class="mb-0">
                        Fans from earlier stops on the Eras Tour report that Taylor usually comes on stage around
                        <strong>8:00–8:15 PM</strong>, after a short changeover from the openers. Expect a very
                        organized but intense experience: long entry lines, lots of friendship bracelets, and a crowd
                        that sings along to almost every song. People recommend arriving early for merch and seating,
                        bringing a clear bag, and planning for a late end time since the set can run over three hours.

                        Past attendees say the festival runs on a loose schedule, with headliners usually starting
                        around <strong>9:30 PM</strong> or later. The atmosphere is described as laid-back during the
                        day and more energetic after sunset. Expect food trucks, long but manageable bathroom lines, and
                        a mix of families and younger crowds. People recommend comfortable shoes, a light jacket for
                        the evening, and planning which stage you want to be at ahead of time because walking between
                        them can take a while.

                        Reviewers from this show said doors opened around 6:30 PM, the opener finished by about 8:00 PM,
                        and Post Malone came on close to <strong>8:30 PM</strong>. Security lines were long but moved
                        steadily, and staff were described as strict but friendly. The sound inside the arena was loud
                        but clear, and most people felt they got a good view thanks to the big screens. The main
                        feedback was that the set felt personal, with pauses between songs where he talked to the
                        crowd, and that many fans stayed until the very end to catch the encore.

                        Fans described this show as very high-energy from start to finish. The openers wrapped up around
                        9:00 PM, but Uzi didn’t take the stage until about <strong>9:45 PM</strong>, which some people
                        liked and others felt was a bit late. Security inside the stadium was visible and active,
                        especially around the pits, and there were several mosh sections near the front. The bass was
                        heavy and the lights were intense, so earplugs and breaks near the back were recommended by
                        people who attended. Most reviews said the show was “worth it” if you’re ready for a loud,
                        packed crowd and don’t mind getting home late.
