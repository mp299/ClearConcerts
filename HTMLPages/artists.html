            Here are a few well-known artists to show how concert experiences could be summarized. Each entry gives a quick
            overview of the type of show a new fan might expect.

                    <p class="mb-1"><strong>Show style:</strong> Mix of rap, rock, and sing-along hits</p>
                    <p class="mb-0">
                        Post Malone’s shows usually feel like a mix of a party and a sing-along. Fans report that he
                        performs a long set with most of his popular songs, and the crowd is very active but generally
                        friendly. Expect lights, visuals, and a lot of people trying to record their favorite moments.
                        This type of show is good for someone who wants a big crowd experience with songs they recognize.

                    <p class="mb-1"><strong>Show style:</strong> Highly produced, themed eras and long setlists</p>
                    <p class="mb-0">
                        Taylor Swift’s concerts are known for being very organized but also very intense in terms of
                        crowd size and energy. Fans often mention detailed stage designs, outfit changes, and long
                        setlists that move through different “eras” of her music. Lines for entry and merch can be long,
                        and many people arrive hours early. This type of show is best for someone who enjoys large
                        productions and doesn’t mind planning ahead for travel and timing.

                    <p class="mb-1"><strong>Show style:</strong> High-energy rap with mosh pits and heavy bass</p>
                    <p class="mb-0">
                        Lil Uzi Vert’s concerts are usually very energetic, with loud bass, jumping crowds, and frequent
                        movement on stage. Fans often describe mosh pits, lots of standing, and a more intense overall
                        environment. Security can be strict, but the crowd can still feel chaotic at times. This type of
                        show is best for someone comfortable in louder, more packed spaces who is looking for a very
                        active concert experience.
