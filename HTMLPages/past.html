                        Doors opened around 6:30 PM and the opener finished by 8:00 PM. Post came on close to
                        <strong>8:30 PM</strong>, which most people felt was reasonable. Security lines outside were long
                        but moved steadily. Inside, the sound was loud but very clear, and the crowd stayed engaged the
                        whole time. Many reviews mentioned that the most emotional songs were near the end, so leaving
                        early would mean missing some of the best moments.

                        The opener wrapped up around 9:00 PM, but Uzi didn’t come on until about
                        <strong>9:45 PM</strong>. Some fans loved the build-up, while others felt the wait was a bit
                        long. Security inside the pit areas was active, breaking up rougher mosh sections when needed.
                        People described the show as intense but fun, with heavy bass and strong visuals. Several
                        reviewers suggested standing farther back if you don’t want to be in the middle of the crowd
                        pushing forward.

                        This event had a relaxed start, with the first act going on around 7:00 PM and the main artist
                        starting closer to <strong>9:00 PM</strong>. The view of the city skyline was the main highlight,
                        and the crowd was described as friendly and low-key. Drinks and small bites were available but
                        a bit pricey. Most attendees said they would go again, but they would bring a light jacket since
                        the rooftop got windy and cooler later in the evening.

                        This festival featured several artists across the afternoon and evening. The main headliner came
                        on a little later than expected, around <strong>10:00 PM</strong>, after some technical delays.
                        Fans liked the variety of performers but mentioned that food and restroom lines became very long
                        after sunset. Many reviews said the atmosphere was fun and energetic, but recommended arriving
                        early and planning breaks so you don’t miss the acts you care about most.

                        This show had seated sections and a more relaxed timeline. The main artist came out around
                        <strong>8:15 PM</strong> after a single opener. Reviews highlighted the clear sound, respectful
                        crowd, and short lines for entry and concessions. People who attended said it was a great option
                        for someone’s first concert because the environment felt calm, organized, and not overwhelming.
